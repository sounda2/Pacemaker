# Pacemaker

## Project Description
In a team of five, we tackled the Boston Scientific Pacemaker System Challenge, which involved developing an effective pacemaker system. Our task encompassed analyzing the provided documentation, defining the project scope, outlining requirements, and implementing both the pacemaker‚Äôs embedded software and a Device Control Module (DCM). The pacemaker was simulated on a hardware platform using a K64F board to represent the pacemaker and an STM32 Nucleo board to simulate the heart, with driver circuits for both. The embedded software was developed using MATLAB Simulink. The DCM, which included a GUI, allowed users to program the pacemaker and manage incoming data. My primary contribution was creating the DCM using Tkinter in Python, and I also assisted with the Simulink programming.
